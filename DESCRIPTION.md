## DESCRIPTION

- This is a C program for a student information system. It starts with a login screen where the user is asked to enter the username and password. If the entered username and password match either "KCCITM" and "admin@123" or "root" and "exit", the user is allowed to access the main menu.

- The main menu has options to add student details, preview student details, add student grades, count the number of students, and exit the program. Each option corresponds to a separate function.

- In the "addStudentDetails" function, the user is prompted to enter various details such as the student's name, registration number, date of birth, etc. The entered information is stored in the corresponding global variables.

- In the "previewStudentDetails" function, the user can preview the details of all the students that have been added so far.

- In the "addStudentGrades" function, the user can add the grades of a student in various subjects such as Mathematics, PPS, etc. The grades are stored in the corresponding global variables.

- In the "countStudents" function, the user can see the total number of students whose details have been added so far.

- In the "exit" function, the program is exited.

- The program continues to run in a loop, giving the user the option to go back to the main menu or exit the program after each operation.
